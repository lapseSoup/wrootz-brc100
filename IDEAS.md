# Wrootz Vision & Ideas

## The Core Vision

**Replace algorithmic curation with economic curation.**

Google ranks by links. Social media ranks by engagement. Both are gameable and create perverse incentives (clickbait, SEO spam, outrage farming). Wrootz ranks by **locked capital** - real skin in the game.

The fundamental insight: When people lock their own money on content, they're making a credible signal about value. This creates a marketplace of trust where quality naturally rises to the top.

## Part 1: Monetization Models for Content

### 1.1 Pay-to-Access Content (Paywalls)

**Basic Paywall**
- Creators set a price to view full content
- Preview shows first X characters/first image
- Revenue split: Owner gets (100% - locker share), lockers split the rest
- Lockers are incentivized to promote paywalled content because they earn from every purchase

**Tiered Access**
- Free tier: Title + preview
- Bronze: Full text content
- Silver: Full content + comments
- Gold: Full content + comments + bonus material + creator chat

**Time-Delayed Free Access**
- Pay now to see immediately
- Or wait X days/blocks for free access
- Creates urgency while still allowing eventual free distribution
- Lockers earn during the paid window

### 1.2 Pay-to-Reply / Pay-to-Comment

**Comment Marketplace**
- Replying to popular posts costs sats
- Revenue goes to post owner + lockers
- Creates a natural spam filter (commenting isn't free)
- High-value conversations become valuable assets themselves
- Replies can themselves be locked on, creating nested value

**Highlighted Replies**
- Pay extra to pin your reply at the top
- Bidding system for top comment slots
- Time-limited highlighting (pay per block of visibility)

**Creator Q&A**
- Fans pay to ask questions
- Creator can set minimum price for their attention
- Creates a "paid AMA" model
- Unanswered questions get refunded after X blocks

### 1.3 Media-Specific Monetization

**Music & Audio**
- Pay-per-play (micropayments per listen)
- First X plays free, then paywalled
- Album bundles with bulk pricing
- Lockers earn royalties on every play
- Stem/remix licensing (pay to download stems)

**Video Content**
- Pay-per-view
- Rental vs purchase model (time-limited access)
- Pay to unlock higher resolution
- Bonus content unlocked at wrootz thresholds

**Images & Art**
- Low-res free, high-res paid
- Commercial license tiers
- Print rights separate from digital
- NFT-like provenance (ownership history tracked)

**Written Content**

### 1.4 Subscription Models

**Creator Subscriptions**
- Monthly/block-based subscriptions to creators
- Subscribers get early access to all content
- Subscription revenue flows to creator + lockers of creator's profile
- Exclusive subscriber-only posts

**Topic Subscriptions**
- Subscribe to tags (e.g., all #bitcoin content)
- Revenue split among all lockers on that tag's content
- Creates incentive for quality curation within topics

### 1.5 Tipping & Appreciation

**Direct Tips**
- Simple tipping to content owners
- Tip jars on profiles
- "Buy me a coffee" equivalent
- Tips can optionally flow through to lockers too

**Appreciation Locks**
- Lock sats purely to show appreciation (no profit motive)
- "Supporter" badge for non-profit-seeking lockers
- Creates a patronage layer on top of speculation
